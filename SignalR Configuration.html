    <td>30  second </td> 
    <td> If the client does not receive the message  ( In this interval, include  keep-alive) , The server will consider the client disconnected .  Because of the way it's implemented , It may take longer for the client to actually mark it as disconnected .  The recommended value is twice the value &nbsp;<code>KeepAliveInterval</code>&nbsp;.</td>

    <td>15  second </td> 
    <td> If the client does not send the initial handshake message within this time interval , The connection will be closed .  This is an advanced setup , The handshake timeout error should only be modified if it occurs due to severe network delay .  More about the handshake process </td>

When changes &nbsp;<code>KeepAliveInterval</code>&nbsp;, Please change &nbsp;<code>ServerTimeout</code>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<code>serverTimeoutInMilliseconds</code>&nbsp; Settings on the client .
